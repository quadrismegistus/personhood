    "    * To do so, need to find the verbs, nouns, adjectives *distinctive of human persons.*\n",
    "    * From the syntax of agency to the *grammar* of personhood.\n",

    "    * *Method A*: Use word2vec, to see if there's a history in a \"humanness\" vector.\n",

    "        * Use humanness vector, or semantic profile more generally, to help predict humanness?\n",

    "2. Toward other genres\n",
    "    * Are these results dependent on poetry? How widespread are they?\n",

    "3. Annotate samples\n",
    "    * Read random sample of instances of abstract nouns, and annotate whether 'personified' or not.\n",
    "    * Could then count these instances as estimates of pervasiveness of personification across history.\n",

    "So far I've measured an [\"agency index\"](https://twitter.com/quadrismegistus/status/1059305496211931136), trying to find trends in how words gain/lose (syntactic) \"agency\" over time. This has been interesting, but what's missing is that personifications don't just do things (as the agency index captures), they do *human* things (\"let not Ambition *mock*\") and have *human* things (\"Honour's voice\").\n",

    "So I'm trying to move on from this 'syntax of agency' to a broader 'grammar of personhood'. I took a failed stopover at the 'semantics of personhood' via word2vec: my 'human words' vector didn't end up being that interesting an index for other words, i.e. didn't seem to capture personification effects. Now I'm moving back to the syntactic BookNLP-style data (subject-verb, modifier-noun, etc) I've collected about the nouns for the Chadwyck Healey poetry collections.\n",

    "I'm wondering whether a classifier to separate human vs. non-human (maybe human vs. object) words by way of the distribution of other words ('collocated' by syntax): and then use that classifier to estimate the 'humanness' of all words, not just those in the cross-validation experiment? I did this in a smaller related project on animal stories, and according to the cross-validation results, the model found it easier to separate humans and animals in novels than it did in these anthropomorphic animal stories, which seemed right. But here I want to use a classifier to estimate the humanness of all, even non-human/object words like abstract nouns, to see if that changes over time?"
